# Air Sofka API

A sophisticated flight reservation and management system designed for commercial airlines, implementing modern software architecture patterns and reactive programming principles to ensure scalability, maintainability, and real-time processing capabilities.

## Core Features

### Flight Reservation Management

- Comprehensive flight booking system with seat selection
- Real-time availability updates and reservation confirmation
- Passenger information management and validation
- Booking modification and cancellation handling

### Flight Administration

- Flight schedule creation and management
- Aircraft assignment and configuration
- Crew allocation and management
- Route planning and optimization

### Real-time Monitoring

- Live flight status tracking
- Capacity utilization analytics
- Booking trend analysis
- Performance metrics and reporting

## Technical Architecture

This project showcases advanced software engineering principles through its carefully designed architecture:

### Architectural Patterns

- **Hexagonal Architecture:** Clear separation between domain logic and external adapters, ensuring business rules remain isolated from infrastructure concerns
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Asynchronous communication between system components through event publishing and subscription
- **Domain-Driven Design:** Deep modeling of the airline domain with bounded contexts, aggregates, and value objects

### Technical Implementation

- **CQRS Pattern:** Separation of command and query responsibilities for optimized performance
- **Reactive Programming:** Non-blocking I/O operations with Spring WebFlux for high throughput
- **Message Broker Integration:** Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) implementation for reliable event distribution
- **NoSQL Database:** MongoDB for flexible document storage and high scalability

## Project Benefits

This API provides airlines with a modern, scalable solution that:

- Enables seamless management of flight operations
- Supports high-volume reservation processing with minimal latency
- Offers flexibility for future expansion and integration
- Ensures system reliability through robust error handling and resilience patterns
- Provides real-time insights for operational decision-making
